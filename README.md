# Glitch Satin

## Description

Experiments in satin transformations in p5.JS, including:

- **Circle Packing**: A circle packing algorithm with an interlacement near the center of each circle [(link)](https://editor.p5js.org/dege9758/sketches/zQG8zgrSr)
- **Paintbrush**: A tabby canvas is transformed with a satin paintbrush [(link)](https://editor.p5js.org/dege9758/sketches/6aPSzbmLq)
- **Image Mapping**: An algorithm filling in a high-contrast image with glitchy satin, in which the minimum and maximum number of interlacements on each row are calculated based on a minimum and maximum float length as input [(link)](https://editor.p5js.org/dege9758/sketches/zT6I2vCmc)
- **Serpinski Triangle**: A cellular automata algorithm is transformed into a satin pattern [todo]
